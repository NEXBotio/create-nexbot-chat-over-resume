Thanks for visiting my blog. I have a lot of interests, and this blog is where I try and bring them all together. Over the past few months, I have been focused on web development and AI. I am the founder and CEO at [NEXBot.io](https://nexbot.io), which I highly recommend you check out if you are interested in building and integrating GPTs into your workflows. You can see a few examples of it in this blog, such as your ability to chat with \`botlando\` (lol). Also, I don't know if you noticed, but you can also select any text in a blog post and have an AI elaborate on it. Check it out by going to a blog post (not this, this is a bio).\n
Building NEXBot, I came across all sorts of interesting techniques that I have been excited to apply in finance. This is why I built this blog. I'll be focusing on bringing front-end oriented technologies into the mix when laying out designs for financial applications. I'll try to make it interesting for web developers and financial practitioners, and we will see what comes out of it. Ultimately, I want to build a quant finance application that includes NEXBot, and I will do so with code, on this blog. I hope you find it interesting.\n
